# Particle Simulator
--------------------------

There are different modes that determine how the particles move which can be activated via keystrokes. Currently, there are two modes that can be combined, a mode for particles to fall to the ground and a mode for particles to be attracted towards each other to form cell-like structures.

F to make the particles fall to the floor<br/>T to make the particles gravitate towards each other

There is also 2D collision dynamics incorporated, particles will glow when a collision check is being computed.

Here we can see the 2D collisions taking place, particles will move in random directions and will glow yellow when a collision check is being processed. To optimise performance, we using sorting algorithms and the transitive property of inequality to avoid collision detection with unnecessary particles.

Formation of cell-like structures with repulsion to avoid particles collapsing.

Particles show chaotic behavior, continuously revolving around each other and forming boomerang-like motions as they are drawn toward the center of mass.
